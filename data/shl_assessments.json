    "description": "As part of Contact Center Simulations, the Customer Service Phone Solution includes a contact center simulation and two behavioral tests designed to measure a wide range of skills, competencies, and behavioral tendencies relevant for contact center jobs. The Contact Center Simulation provides an opportunity for candidates to interact with simulated customers in a contact center environment. Designed to measure a candidate’s ability to listen attentively to the customer, take ownership of customer issues, resolve issues, navigate to find information, and enter information accurately, the Contact Center Simulation is intended to measure how a candidate will respond in a variety of customer situations and assess the candidate’s computer skills in a contact center setting. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate’s learning potential and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles.\"Please note that for Simplified Chinese version the audio is available in both Mandarin and Cantonese.\"",

    "description": "SHL 360, or the Multi-Rater Feedback System (‘MFS’), provides a holistic 360-degree view of an employee by gathering feedback from the employee’s manager, peers, direct reports, and/or other raters.  By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others.  360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share.  SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback.  360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
